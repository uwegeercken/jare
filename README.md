Java Rule Engine source files.

The Rule Engine allows to implement business rules in a central location and outside the code - be it a web application, a standalone application, an ETL tool or any other java based tool - so that, if the rules change the code does not have to change - only the rules change.

There is a web application available, which allows to define rules in an easy and quick way. yet very complex scenarios are possible by combining rules with "and" and "or" conditions and by grouping them together.

You may download the jar library which contains the sources compiled with Java 1.6

Please send your feedback and help to enhance the tool.
